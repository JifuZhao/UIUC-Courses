The initial data generated are stored in the folder named ./data.
To make sure all data will not be changed, the matlab code for data generation are in the folder named ./generator.
If you want to re-generate the data, you need to copy the three *.m file from ./generator folder to the local folder.
NOTE: if you re-run these three files, the result will not be the same with my report.

If you just want to test my result, you don't need to generate the data again.



In this folder, there is a lot of matlab (*.m) files, but if you want to test the result, you just need to run the 4 files named:

experiment1.m
experiment2.m
experiment3.m
experiment4.m

All data are stored in the folder named ./data.
All result are stored in the folder named ./result.

There are 6 txt file corresponding to 6 experiment.
There are 5 figures as required


If any question, please contact me at: jzhao59@illinois.edu

Thanks

Jifu
