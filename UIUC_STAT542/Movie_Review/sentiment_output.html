With all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ i've started listening to his music, watching the <span class="neg">odd</span> documentary here and there, watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again. Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really <span class="pos">cool</span> in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. Some of it has subtle messages about MJ's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are <span class="neg">bad</span> m'kay.  Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely <span class="pos">like</span> MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.  The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ dead so <span class="neg">bad</span> is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates MJ's music.  Lots of <span class="pos">cool</span> things in this <span class="pos">like</span> MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy <span class="neg">Bad</span> sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.  Bottom line, this movie is for people who <span class="pos">like</span> MJ on one level or another (which i think is most people). If not, then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most <span class="pos">talented</span> people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention i've gave this subject....hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors, i know this for a fact. He is either an extremely nice but <span class="neg">stupid</span> guy or one of the most sickest liars. I hope he is not the latter.

\The Classic War of the Worlds\ by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to <span class="pos">great</span> effort and lengths to faithfully recreate H. G. Wells' classic book. Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so. I, and those who watched his film with me, <span class="pos">appreciated</span> the fact that it was not the standard, predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, e.g. the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. Those who envision themselves as amateur \critics\ look only to criticize everything they can. Others rate a movie on more important <span class="pos">bases,like</span> being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the \critics\. We enjoyed the effort Mr. Hines put into being faithful to H.G. Wells' classic novel, and we found it to be very entertaining. This made it easy to overlook what the \critics\ perceive to be its <span class="neg">shortcomings.</span>
