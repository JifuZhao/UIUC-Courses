Dearly Beloved,

Please read this slowly and carefully, as =
it may be one of the most
important emails you ever get.I am Mrs. Mi=
chelle Richard, I was
married to Late Robert Richard.He used to work=
 with Shell Petroleum
Development Company London and was also a seas=
oned contractor in the
West African Region.He died on Monday,31 July=
, 2003 in Paris. We were
married for seven years without a child=
..

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, beca=
use, I
Believe Everyone will die someday. I have been diagnosed with=

Esophagus cancer and My Doctor told me that I would not last long d=
ue
to my complicated health issues.

I want God to be merc=
iful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided
to give alms to cha=
rity organizations /churches/ Mosque / Temples/
motherless/ babies/le=
ss privileged/widows, as I want this to be one of
the last good deed=
s I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to
some charity or=
ganizations in the Oman, Algeria, Brazil and Malaysia.
Now that my h=
ealth has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself
anymore=
..

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts=
 and
distribute the money which I have there to charity organization=
 in
India, Nepal, Pakistan, Syria and Iraqi, they refused and kept th=
e
money to themselves.Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they se=
em
not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of m=
y
money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Six Millio=
n
united state dollars $6,000,000.00 that I have with a bank in Lond=
on
where I deposited the fund. I will want you to dispatch it to cha=
rity
organizations if only you will be sincere.

I took th=
is decision because I don't have any child that will inherit
this mo=
ney, I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.I
know t=
hat I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. As soon as I
receive y=
our reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank and issue
you a l=
etter of authorization that will empower you as the
original-benefici=
ary of this fund.

I want you to always pray for me,Any delay in=
 your reply will give me
room in sourcing for another individual for=
 this same purpose.If you
are not interested,kindly pardon me for co=
ntacting you. You can reach
me with or Reply me at my private
e-m=
ail:(zzz@xxx.yyy).

Thanks,
Yours sincere=
ly,
Mrs. Michelle Richard
