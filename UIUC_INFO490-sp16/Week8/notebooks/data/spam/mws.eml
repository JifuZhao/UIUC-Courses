Is there a Milk that is Worse than Smoking?
------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2/29/2016


Attention xxxyyy@ncsa.uiuc.edu,

There are overwhelming statistics showing that the food you eat is killing you.

Did you know that there is an engineered growth hormone in some types of milk that is now linked to cancer.

This makes these milks worse than smoking 4 packs of cigarettes a day.

Unfortunately, everyone is unaware what type of milk it is.

I bet you have it in your fridge right now... Just like I did.


Go here now to find out what is slowly killing you: http://xxx.yyy.zzz/exclusive
