Peer Review Grading
by Robert Brunner - Monday, 29 February 2016, 10:22 AM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I have received several emails or private Moodle messages regarding peer
grading. The basic context seems to be concern about losing a few points
from one reviewer.=20

To=20be clear, we do not intervene in Peer Assessment unless there has ben =
an
egregious violation. An example of this would be someone giving a zero and
saying 'The code does not run' when it clearly does run. Or 'The code is
empty' when the assignment was completed. Losing a few points occasionally
will not lower your grade. And other than write the best code you possibly
can and document it thoroughly, we do not have any advice!=20

The=20point of peer review is two-fold:=20

1)=20You get a chance to see how your peers completed an assignment. In som=
e
case, you might learn how to improve your own code, learn new coding
tricks, or see ways that your coding style could improve.=20

2)=20You have your code reviewed by your peers and obtain comments from the=
m
that (hopefully) will be constructive and help you improve your work. In
some cases, a review might grade you lower than you like, or in seeming
contrast to others.=20

Learning=20to deal with situations like this is part of the course. You wil=
l
(probably) experience many of these situations later in your career, either
via an interview (which is a form of peer assessment), in the workplace
with pair coding or code reviews, or just via general interactions at
conferences or public meetings. And if you ever release code online, expect
comments and criticisms!=20

Finally,=20please remember that this is a large online course, which Edward
and I are building as the course is being offered. Please refrain from
frivolous questions or peer assessment regrade requests; otherwise, we will
be forced to invoke point reductions:=20

https://github.com/UI-DataScience/info490-sp16/blob/master/orientation/syll=
abus.md#point-reductions


and=20also the special point reduction under the Peer Review section:=20

https://github.com/UI-DataScience/info490-sp16/blob/master/orientation/syll=
abus.md#peer-review


Having=20said this, please understand we encourage valid questions; we do n=
ot
want to stifle the learning process.=20
