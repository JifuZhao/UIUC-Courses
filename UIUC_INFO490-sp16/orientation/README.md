In this course, we will be using a JupyterHub server that is running on
the CS department's cloud computing system. To access this system, you
must be on the University network. If you wish to work off campus, you
must first [VPN](https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn)
into campus. To learn how to connect to this server, and
how to work with the course material, you should logon to the [course
server][cs], and locate, run, and explore the [Introduction to
IPython](notebooks/intro2ipy.ipynb) notebook to become familiar with
using notebooks on the course JupyterHub server. 

To logon on to the server, you will need to authenticate via Shibboleth.
Next, you will click on the `My Server` button. This will give you a
Jupyter Server interface, which should be familiar to you from the
previous INFO490 course. Note that we include read only copies of the
data and course material and writeable versions so you can experiment
and learn.

## Tips for Success ##

To do well in this course, remember the following:

- Log in frequently to manage your messages on a near-daily basis. If
you let them pile up for 3 to 4 days, you might be overwhelmed. You
should start working on new weekly content right away, on Monday of each
week.

- Stay on top of the course work. Falling behind will make it harder to
catch up, and even harder to understand new concepts that build on
previous lessons.

- Consider using a source code repository to archive all of your work so
that you have an automatic backup copy of all your assignments. This
will also be useful in the unlikely event that our server goes down and
we are unable to access course submissions. In this situation, you are
still required to keep current on all your tasks and must be prepared to
submit completed materials as soon as submission capability is restored.

- When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this
class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow.
One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your
peers pose. By engaging with each other, we'll all learn better.
