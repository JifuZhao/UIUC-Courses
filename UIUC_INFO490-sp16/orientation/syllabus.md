# INFO 490: Advanced Data Science #

INFO 490: Advanced Data Science explores advanced concepts in data
science by employing a practical approach, including machine learning;
probabilistic programming; text, network, and graph analysis; and cloud
computing.

## Course Goals ##

Upon completion of this course, students will be expected to understand
advanced data science concepts. Students will learn the practical
aspects of applying machine and statistical learning in a variety of
contexts, as well as different aspects of cloud computing. Specific
concepts that will be covered including supervised and unsupervised
learning, dimensional reduction, clustering, probabilistic programming,
text mining, graph analysis, network analysis, Hadoop, NoSQL data
stores, Spark, and streaming data analysis.

## Prerequisites ##

As a pre-requisite for this course, you must have mastered the material
in *INFO 490: Foundations of Data Science*. Generally, this is
demonstrated by having taken this previous course. However, instructor
approval can also be granted for those who can demonstrate proficiency
in the required topics.

Note: At present, we are using the CS department's cluster to run a
course JupyterHub server. Each student is running a Dockerized version
of the course software stack. This provides many advantages including
robustness against crashes, simplicity of deploying software updates,
reduced requirements for students (simply a modern web browser, we have
used tablets and smart phones), and simplifying assignment submission.
You can also run a Docker container locally, as in previous courses, but
this approach is not recommended. In addition, if you work locally,
since assignments are automatically collected from your cloud-based
Docker container, you must ensure that you push local changes to your
course cloud Docker container prior to the deadline.

As part of the orientation week activities, we have provided a demo
[IPython Notebook](notebooks/intro2ip.ipynb) that you should use to get
familiar with working in an IPython Notebook on the course JupyterHub
server. Each week there will be an `index.ipynb` IPython Notebook that
will give you access to the different course notebooks for that week,
please use these on the course server to move through the course
material.

## Texts ##

There are no required textbooks for this course. Instead, we will
utilize Internet accessible websites, videos, and documentation as
supplemental material to the lesson content. We also will include links,
as relevant, to readings from books that are freely available to
University of Illinois students, staff and faculty via the University's
Safari subscription.

## Academic Integrity ##

Academic honesty is essential to this course and the University. Any
instance of academic dishonesty (including but not limited to cheating,
plagiarism, falsification of data, and alteration of grades) will be
documented in the student's academic file. In addition, **at a minimum**
the particular assessment, quiz, or assignment will be given a zero.
Serious or repeated offenses may be punished more severely.

**Guidelines for collaborative work**: Discussing course material with
your classmates is in general a good idea, but each student is expected
to do his or her own work. On assignments, you may discuss the problems
and concepts behind them, but you are responsible for your own answers.
Please do not post code in the forums! Finally, on assessments and
quizzes, your answers must of course be your own. For further info, see
the [Student Code, Part 4. Academic
Integrity](http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article_1/a1_1-401.html).

## Communication ##

The instructional staff will use the [Announcement Forum][af] on the
course Moodle to communicate important course information. Do not
unsubscribe from this forum or you risk missing important news!

The preferred method for student communication in this course is to use
the [Q&A Forum][qaf] on the course Moodle. The instructional staff monitors this
forum and will respond in less than 24 hours (in general we will respond
even faster than this, especially during normal business hours).
Furthermore, your fellow students may be able to help even faster. We
also encourage you to search this forum prior to making a new post since
your question may have already been answered.  You can search a forum on
Moodle by using the __Search forums__ tool that is located on the upper
right corner of any Moodle forum.

If you have a question (that is not answered in this syllabus nor on the
online course forums) you can email the instructional staff, however,
this should be a last resort. If we feel the question is best answered
on the [Q&A Forum][qaf], we reserve the right to post your question and
our answer on Moodle. Also, note the information contained in the
__Point Reductions__ section of this syllabus.

Finally, we have created a [gitter room][gr] for this course. This is a
completely public, real-time communication channel that you can also use
to ask questions.

## Course Outline ##

Note: The following list of topics is tentative. We build the course
during the semester for several reasons:

1. This is a new course (in a new field)!
2. The enrolled students span multiple colleges and even more
departments across the University of Illinois.
3. Both undergraduate and graduate students are enrolled.

As a result, we feel it is imperative to be able to change the planned
pace and material to benefit the majority of enrolled students.

## Weekly Format ##

Each week will provide learning objectives and an outline of the
activities for that week with a list of all deadlines and corresponding
point values for assignments.

### Videos ###

Each week there will be at least one instructor created video that will
offer a broader context for the new week, explain key concepts, and
demonstrate important tasks. To view the instructor videos, you will
need to login to the Illinois Mediaspace (links are embedded in the
relevant weekly overview). You will be given twenty points for viewing
each weekly instructor overview video. In case you are wondering,
Illinois Mediaspace tracks the viewing of course videos, so we know not
only if you load a video, but how much of the video you actually watched.

### Readings ###

Readings will consist of articles and excerpts from books and Web sites,
internet-accessible videos demonstrating a concept, and, in some cases,
IPython Notebooks that can be viewed statically on the Github website,
or (via the preferred approach) by interacting with them via the course
JupyterHub server. You will be required to read and be familiar with the
content of these documents. Readings are contextualized as part of the
weekly lesson content and are located in the "Readings" section of each
lesson.

### Lessons ###

Lessons will expand upon, or clarify key concepts in the reading
assignments or supplement or add to the reading. All lessons for a given
week must be completed by 6:00 PM Central on Thursday of that week.

### Lesson Assessments ###

Each week will contain three lesson modules (except for the last week,
which will contain only one). A lesson module will will include a Moodle
quiz designed to be taken after completing the readings and carefully
reviewing the lesson material. Lesson quizzes will allow two attempts,
to ensure students have mastered the relevant material before advancing
to the next lesson module. The lessons assessments must all be completed
by 6:00 PM Central on Thursday of that week.

### Assignments ###

**Note: This section is still being finalized.**

Every week but the first and last will contain an assignment that will
involve one or more computational tasks related to the focus for that
given week. Your assignment will be automatically collected at the
deadline from the course JupyterHub server. These assignments will be
automatically graded for your instructor grade, and will also be
randomly distributed for peer assessment. You will have **up to five**
assignments to grade as part of peer assessment. You will receive thirty
points for simply grading your peer's assignments. Your peer assessment
score will be worth a maximum of forty points, and we will drop the
highest and lowest score and average the three remaining scores.

<!--
However, you must submit your assignment for peer grading by using the
Moodle Assignment tool. (Note we are exploring ways to do this within
the course server and may update this process during the course).

Each week you will be given instructions on how to complete the
assignment, as well as directions on exactly what you must submit to the
course Moodle site. Generally this will be in the form of an IPython
notebook. 
-->

To receive full credit from instructor grading, your assignment must be
submitted prior to the deadline. There will be a 18-hour grace period,
in which an assignment can be submitted, albeit with an automatic 50%
reduction in the maximum possible score. After this grace period, no
assignments will be accepted. The full credit assignment deadline is
6:00 PM Central on the Monday following the relevant week. 

### Peer Review ###

Weekly assignments will be reviewed by your course peers, as well as
automatic instructor grading. 70 points (out of the maximum 150 points
for each assignment) for each weekly assignment submission
will derive from peer review, 80 points (out of the maximum 150 points
for each assignment) are assigned from automated instructor review. You will
receive 30 points each week for simply viewing and grading your peers'
assignments. Note that you can (and should) still grade your peers even
if you miss an assignment submission. Peer review of an assignment must
be completed by 6:00 PM Central on Saturday of the following week (i.e.,
you submit your assignment on a Monday and you must peer assess other
students assignments by the following Saturday). You will be assigned
assignments to grade approximately one hour after the late assignment
deadline, thus around 1:00 pm Tuesday afternoon of each week.

| **Item** | **Grade** | 
|----|----| 
| Instructor Assessment | 80 points |  
| Peer Grading | 30 points | 
|Peer Assessments | 40 points| 
| **Total** |  **150** points |

Note that we will *only* review clearly erroneous peer assessments (this
means there needs to be a major problem). Review requests that are
deemed insignificant are subject to an *instructor determined point
reduction*.

### Weekly Quizzes ###

In addition to the lesson quizzes, each week will conclude with a weekly
quiz. The weekly quiz is designed to test your overall mastery of the
content for each given week. Unlike the lesson quizzes, weekly quizzes
will be timed and will not allow multiple attempts. The quiz must be
completed by 6:00 PM Central on Friday of that week.

### Exams ###

This course is project-based in its use of assignments that build
progressively on content mastery, application, and peer review; there
are no exams in this course.

## Grading ##

### Grading Distribution ###
|Assignment | Points| Occurrences| Total Points |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
|Pre-Class Activity: Introduce Yourself| 60|1|60|
|Orientation Quiz|70|1|70|
|Lesson Assessments|60|14 (Week 15 is only 20 points)|860|
|Weekly Quizzes|70|14 (No quiz in Week 15)|980|
|Weekly Overview Videos|20|16 (including the Orientation Week Video)|320|
|Assignments (Weeks 2-14)|150|13 |1950|
|***Total***|||***4240***|

Unlike past courses, we do not plan on dropping any weekly scores.

### Grading Scale ###

Final grades will be graded on a curve, if necessary. The letter grade
cutoffs will be set at the traditional 90%, 80%, and 70% limits, and
plus/minus will be added if you are within two points of the traditional
cutoffs (so 100–98 is an A+ and 90–92 is an A-).

|Percentage|Letter Grade|
|--------|---------|
|98-100|A+|
|92-98|A|
|90-92|A-|
|88-90|B+|
|82-88|B|
|80-82|B-|
|78-80|C+|
|72-78|C|
|70-72|C-|
|68-70|D+|
|62-68|D|
|60-62|D-|
|Below 60|F|

### Point Reductions ###

This is a large, online course with only one instructor and one teaching
assistant. Thus we require that students read the syllabus and search
online forums before either emailing us directly or posting a new
question in the Moodle forums. Failure to abide by this request may, at
the sole discretion of the instructor, result in a loss of five points
per **obvious** infraction. Please note that we are not trying to stifle
questions (such as why is the FAA server down?). We simply need to
minimize the number of such emails/questions we receive.

### Extra Credit ###

There is a course Wiki hosted on the course github repository. If you
have a problem and obtain a solution (either through your own efforts or
in partnership with an instructor), consider writing your problem and
solution up as a FAQ post in the github wiki. You get extra credit for
doing this and also help your classmates!

To get credit for your wiki entry you must contact the course assistant,
Samantha Thrush. She will review your post and indicate how many points
you will receive, and if she would be willing to review an edited post
for additional information. You can submit multiple Wiki entries.
