#Pre-Class Activity#

This [activity is on Moodle][pca], where the instructions are also shown
along with the actual forum where you can complete these tasks.

## Introduce Yourself##

Welcome! Before the course formally begins, I’d like you to take a few
minutes to introduce yourself to the class and get to know your
classmates a bit. Some of the work you do in this course, like the peer
review, will involve some degree of interaction with your peers.
Establishing personal interaction with your peers early in the course
will make your online learning experience much more enjoyable and
engaging.


## Time Estimate##
Approximately 1 hour.

## Instructions##
### Part 1: Updating Your Profile###

If you haven't already done so, you should update your Moodle profile.
Your Moodle profile gives your classmates easy access to a little bit
about you. Since your classmates can quickly access your Moodle profile
almost any time they see your name listed within the course, it is a
powerful tool for helping them to get to know you and vice versa.
Additionally, when you update your Moodle profile photo, it shows up
next to your name in discussion forums, which is a great help to those
individuals who can remember faces more readily than names. So, your
first task is to update your Moodle profile.

Here are [Instructions for Updating Your Moodle 
Profile](http://publish.illinois.edu/atlas-tlt/students/editing-your-profile/)

### Part 2: Introductions ###

Second, use the Pre-Class Activity Moodle discussion forum to provide a brief 2-3 paragraph
introduction to your classmates. In your post, please consider the following questions:

- What is your name? What do you prefer to be called?
- Where are you from?
- What year are you in school and what is your major?
- What topic from the syllabus most interests you?
- What type of data are you interested in exploring in more detail?
- What experience do you have with cloud computing?

Post your self-introduction by clicking the `Add a new discussion topic` button.

Read your classmates’ postings. Pick at least one of your classmates’
postings that is most interesting to you and add your friendly comments.
Also be sure to click on the name or profile picture of your other
classmates to see what they have added to their profile.
