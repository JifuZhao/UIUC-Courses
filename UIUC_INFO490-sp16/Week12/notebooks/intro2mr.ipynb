    "\n",
    "In this IPython Notebook, we introduce the map/reduce programming\n",
    "paradigm. Simply put, this approach to computing breaks tasks down into\n",
    "a map phase (where an algorithm is mapped onto data) and a reduce phase,\n",
    "where the outputs of the map phase are aggregated into a concise output.\n",
    "The map phase is designed to be parallel, and to move the computation to\n",
    "the data, which, when using HDFS, can be widely distributed. In this\n",
    "case, a map phase can be executed against a large quantity of data very\n",
    "quickly. The map phase identifies keys and associates with them a value.\n",
    "The reduce phase collects keys and aggregates their values. The standard\n",
    "example used to demonstrate this programming approach is a word count\n",
    "problem, where words (or tokens) are the keys) and the number of\n",
    "occurrences of each word (or token) is the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this technique was popularized by large web search companies like\n",
    "Google and Yahoo who were processing large quantities of unstructured\n",
    "text data, this approach quickly became popular for a wide range of\n",
    "problems.  Of course, not every problem can be transformed into a\n",
    "map-reduce approach, which is why we will explore Spark in several\n",
    "weeks. The standard MapReduce approach uses Hadoop, which was built\n",
    "using Java. Rather than switching to a new language, however, we will\n",
    "use Hadoop Streaming to execute Python code. In the rest of this\n",
    "notebook, we introduce a simple Python WordCount example code. We first\n",
    "demonstrate this code running at the Unix command line, before switching\n",
    "to running the code by using Hadoop Streaming.\n",
