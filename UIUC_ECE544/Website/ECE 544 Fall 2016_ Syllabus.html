	<p>ECE 544NS is a special topics course in pattern recognition.  Content varies every year, but usually includes error metrics (e.g., information-theoretic and perceptron-based) and optimization (e.g., neural network, Bayesian, stochastic, and convex programming techniques) for the supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised estimation of probability densities, feature selection, regression and classification.  In fall 2016, the course will focus on neural networks, as a mechanism by which we may understand a wide variety of problems in pattern recognition.  More detail is provided in the lists of <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece544na/quizzes.html">quizzes</a> and <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece544na/homework.html">homework assignments</a>.</p>

	<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
	<p>Probability and linear algebra.</p>

	<h3>Text</h3>
	<p>Students are expected to read, understand, and apply the
	articles assigned as background for each homework
	assignment.</p>

	<h3>Grading</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Homework:</b> 45 percent</li>
	  <li><b>Exams:</b> 40 percent</li>
	  <li><b>Project:</b> 15 percent</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Homework</h3>
	<p>Each homework will include (a) a written part, in which you
	derive or design an algorithm, (b) a Python part, in which you
	code and test your solution, (c) many will also include a
	TensorFlow part, in which you test a solution to the same
	problem using TensorFlow.</p>

	<h3>Exams</h3>
	<p>There will be two exams, each consuming a full class
	period, and one long written homework that counts as if it were an
	exam.  Problems will be designed to be similar to problems
	you've previously seen in quizzes and/or homework.</p>

	<h3>Project</h3>
	<p>During the last two weeks of the semester, in place of
	  homework, students will design their own final project.</p>
