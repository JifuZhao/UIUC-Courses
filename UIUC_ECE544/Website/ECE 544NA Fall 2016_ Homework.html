	  Homework should be submitted

	  ECE544NA, by midnight (Urbana time) on the due date.

	<a name="whattosubmit"><h2>What to submit</h2></a>
	
	<p>You will submit a narrative report (PDF format), plus some auxiliary files:</p>
	<h3>Pencil and paper part</h3>

	<p>In this part, you show
	  the derivation of an algorithm.  Your derivation should
	  be submitted electronically in any form that is
	  mathematically expressive enough to be graded.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>Acceptable:</b>
	      <ul>
		<li>LaTeX (compile it to PDF, and include it as part
		  of your narrative report).</li>
		<li>Equations produced using the Equation Tools in
		  Microsoft Office 2010 or later; this can be
		  included in your narrative report.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li><b>UNACCEPTABLE:</b>
	      <ul>
		<li>Office files (.doc) that do not use the Word 2010+
		  Equation Tools.  WARNING!!! If you don't know
		  whether or not you're using Equation Tools, then
		  most likely, you're not.  Check with somebody.  If
		  you write your equations using regular Word
		  formatting tools, but NOT using Equation Tools,
		  then they will be considered "illegible
		  pseudo-equations," and will receive 0 points.</li>
		<li>Plaintext pseudo-equations, HTML
		  pseudo-equations, or pseudo-equations written in
		  any other format that was not specifically
		  designed to communicate math.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	  <h3>Code-From-Scratch Part:</h3>
	<p>In this part of
	  each assignment, you should submit</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>A "Methods" section, of up to two pages + one
	    figure, describing the algorithms you implemented.</li>
	  <li>A "Results" section, of up to two pages + four
	    figures or tables, describing your results.  If an
	    assignment has a "right answer," then you will
	    lose points if you fail to demonstrate the right
	    answer.  Make sure that this section shows clearly
	    that you got the right answer using your own code.
	  </li>
	  <li>Your code should be submitted as an auxiliary
	    file, in TGZ or ZIP format.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The code-from-scratch part can be written in any programming
	language you like.  We recommend Python or Matlab, but
	it's up to you.</p>

	<h3>TensorFlow:</h3>
	<p>In this part of each assignment,
	    you should submit:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>A "Methods" section, of up to one pages + one
	    figure, describing the algorithm you implemented.</li>
	  <li>A "Results" section, of up to one page + two
	    figures or tables, describing your results.  If an
	    assignment has a "right answer," then you will
	    lose points if you fail to demonstrate the right
	    answer.  Make sure that this section shows clearly
	    that you got the right answer using your own code.
	  </li>
	  <li>Your code should be submitted as an auxiliary
	    file, in TGZ or ZIP format.</li>
	</ol>
	The TensorFlow part of each assignment must be written
	in Python.

	<a name="toolboxes"><h2>Toolboxes</h2></a>
	<p><b>Code-From-Scratch:</b> this section of each assigment
	  has detailed limits on what you can and can't use.
	  </p><ul>
	    <li><b>Can Use:</b> Signal processing, Fourier
	      transform, and linear algebra toolboxes in matlab
	      or SciPy.  The VoiceBox toolbox for matlab.
	      Anything in BLAS or LAPACK.
	    </li>
	    <li><b>Can't Use:</b> Neural Network, Machine
	      Learning, or Optimization toolboxes in Matlab or
	      SciPy.  Any open source machine learning toolbox
	      (WEKA, libSVM, svmlight, Hinton's RBM toolbox).
	      Any open source speech recognizer (HMM toolbox for
	      Matlab, HTK, Kaldi, GMTK, Sphinx, Julius, etc.).
	      Any open source computer vision toolbox (if you
	      think there are tools from OpenCV that should be
	      OK to use, please check with us first).
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	<p></p>
	<p><b>TensorFlow:</b> in this section of each assigment, you
	  should use TensorFlow tools, but you can also use tools from
	  any other toolbox that you find useful.
	  Anything that you can download from the web is OK, but you must
	  use it in exactly the form it was downloaded: your own code should
	  remain separate from the downloaded toolbox.
	</p>

	<a name="academichonesty"><h2>Academic Honesty</h2></a>

	<p><b>Software Teams:</b> You may write software in teams of
	  up to three people.  Comments at the beginning of each
	  software file should specify all of the members of the team
	  as authors.  Different teams can share ideas, but can't
	  share code.  Too strong a resemblance between the code of
	  any two teams may result in loss of points.</p>

	<p><b>No Teams for Narrative Reports:</b> Each person should
	    write his or her own narrative report, including the
	    pencil-and-paper part.</p>

	<p><b>Web Sources:</b> If you follow the advice or sequencing
	  of an on-line source, cite it.  You may lose points if your
	  code too strongly resembles that of any on-line source.</p>

	<p><b>Piazza:</b>  You can post pseudo-code on piazza, but not
	  actual code.</p>
	<hr>

	<a name="latepolicy"><h2>Late Homework Policy</h2></a>

	<p>Late homework will be accepted, up to seven days after the
	due date.  The penalty for late homework is multiplicative:
	your total homework score will be multiplied by 0.9 for each
	day that the homework is late (0.9 up to 24 hours late, 0.81
	24-48 hours late, etc.).  You must submit all parts of your
	homework at the same time: if you submit part of your homework
	on time, and part of it late, then <b>all</b> of the
	assignment will be graded as if late.</p>
