THIS IS THE SUBSET DATASET!!!! (10K files instead of 1M)

The dataset contains the analysis and metadata for a million songs.
The goal is to provide a large dataset for researchers to report results 
on, hence encouraging algorithms that scale to commercial sizes.

Most of the information is provided by The Echo Nest.
The dataset is the result of a collaboration between The Echo Nest
and LabROSA at Columbia University.

Most of the data is licensed the same way as Echo Nest's API.
