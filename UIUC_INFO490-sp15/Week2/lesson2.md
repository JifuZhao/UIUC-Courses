# Week 2 Lesson 2#
## Unix Data Processing ##

In this lesson, you will focus on using Unix commands to perform basic data processing at the Unix command prompt. Specifically you will learn about commands like grep, awk, and sed and how they can be used to extract rows of data from large files that meet certain conditions. In addition, you will learn how these commands can be combined with other Unix commands via pipes to perform fast, sophisticated data processing tasks. Finally, you will learn about persisting these data processing pipelines as Unix shell scripts.

## Objectives: ##

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Write and use a grep command to extract lines form a file that match a specific pattern.
- Write and use an awk program to perform simple data processing.
- Write and use a sed script to transform lines in a file.
- Understand the basic Unix data processing commands such as cat, uniq, wc, and sort.
- Write a simple Unix shell script.

## Time Estimate##
Approximately 3 hours.

## Readings ##

- Read chapters 18-20, and 24 from the free book [The Linux Command Line (PDF)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxcommand/?source=dlp) and follow along by entering the commands as directed into a terminal window within your virtual machine.
