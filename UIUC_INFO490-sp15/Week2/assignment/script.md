## Week 2 Assignment

### Recording your session

We will use the `script` command tool to record our session. `script` records everything that happens on your terminal session. To use `script`, simply type

```console
$ script
```

If no argument is given, it writes to a file named _typescript_. You can later rename this file to _filename.txt_, where _filename_ should be your *firstname-lastname-script*. Or you can write to a different file from the beginning by 

```console
$ script firstname-lastname-script.txt
```
When you are done, type

```console
$ exit
```
This will end the session and save the file. You should upload the this file to Moodle.
