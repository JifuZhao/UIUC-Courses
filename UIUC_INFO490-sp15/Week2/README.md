## Introduction to Command-Line Data Science ##

In this week, you will learn to perform data science tasks at the Unix prompt. First, you will learn about working with data by using the Vim text editor, how to work with networked resources, and how to find relevant files located within a Unix file system. Next, you will learn about some simple yet powerful Unix tools to perform basic data processing at the command prompt, and how to turn these into persistent Shell programs. Finally, you will learn about source code versioning tools and in particular learn how to use git to maintain a software project.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Perform basic text editing at the Unix command prompt by using the Vim editor.
- Find and access files and resources located within the Unix File System.
- Perform data processing at the Unix Command Line.
- Understand the basics of a Shell program.
