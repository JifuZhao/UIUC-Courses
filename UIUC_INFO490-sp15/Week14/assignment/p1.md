## Problem 14.1. Google Compute Engine.

- There is no template for this problem.

Do the following:

- Read and follow along
  [Week 14 Lesson 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week14/intro2gc.ipynb).
- Keep the VM **running** at least until Tuesday, May 5th, 2015, 6:00 PM.
  If you have shut down the VM as demonstrated in the last
  section of 
  [Week 14 Lesson 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week14/intro2gc.ipynb),
  restart the VM.
- `git clone` the course repository onto your Google Cloud SDK Docker
  container,
- Start an IPython notebook server with the cloned directory mapped to
  `/notebooks/i2ds`, and
- Submit a text file named `gcloud.txt` onto Moodle with the following items:
  - Your first and last name,
  - The external IP address of your Google Cloud SDK Docker container, and
  - The password of IPython notebook server. 

For peer review, do the following:
- Type the IP address in your web browser,
- Type in the password,
- Navigate to `/notebooks/i2ds/spring2015/week14`,
- Open `hello.ipynb`, and
- Run the code cell.
Your peer gets the full credit if it prints out
```text
hello
```
