## Problem 14.3. Hadoop.

- There is no template for this problem.
- Use the Hadoop Docker container and Hadoop Streaming as demonstrated in
  [Week 14 Lesson 3](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week14/intro2dh.ipynb)
  to run `mapper.py` and `reducer.py` that you wrote in
  [Problem 14.2](https://github.com/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week14/p3.md).

- Use `script` as we did in
  [Week 2](https://github.com/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week02/script.md)
  to record your session.
  The `script` command can be run either from the Boot2Docker command prompt
  or within the Hadoop Docker container.
  If you run it from the Boot2Docker command prompt, you can move
  the file to `/c/Users/<username>` (Windows) or `/Users/<username>` (OS X)
  and access the file from your host OS.
  If you run `script` in the Hadoop Docker container,
  you can use the shared folders specified in the `-v` or `--volumes-from`
  option to transfer the file to your host OS.
- Rename your `script` file to `hadoop.txt` and submit onto Moodle.
- At the end, run

```bash
/i2ds/hadoop# $HADOOP_PREFIX/bin/hdfs dfs -cat wc/out/part-00000 | \
    sort -n -k 2 | tail -10
```

which should print out

```

- Don't forget that the encoding of `2001.csv` is `latin-1`.
