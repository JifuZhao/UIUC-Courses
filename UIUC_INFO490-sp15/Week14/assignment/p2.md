## Problem 14.2. MapReduce.

- There is no template for this problem.
- Modify the "word count" map/reduce example in
  [Week 14 Lesson 3](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week14/intro2dh.ipynb)
  to count the number of airports in the `Origin` column of `2001.csv`.
- Submit both `mapper.py` and `reducer.py` onto Moodle.
- Remember that the encoding of `2001.csv` is `latin-1`.
  There are many ways to handle this, but as suggest in
  [Week 14 Lesson 3](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week14/intro2dh.ipynb),
  the simplest solution is to set the Python environment variable
  `PYTHONIOENCODING` to `latin-1`.

- When you run

```bash
./mapper.py < 2001.csv | sort -n -k 1 | ./reducer.py | sort -n -k 2 | tail -10
```

you should get
