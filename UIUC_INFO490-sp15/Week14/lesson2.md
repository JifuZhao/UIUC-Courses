# Week 14 Lesson 2 #
## Running Containers in the Cloud ##

In this lesson, you will learn how to use the Google compute engine. Specifically, you will learn how to register to use the Google compute engine, before learning how to instantiate a google compute virtual machine. Next you will learn how to use a local GCE Docker container to authenticate and connect to a running Google Compute Engine VM. Finally, you will learn how to deploy our course Docker image as a running container in your Google Compute Engine VM.
