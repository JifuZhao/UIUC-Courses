# Week 5 Lesson 2 #
## Introduction to Python Plotting with Matplotlib ##

In this lesson, you will learn to work with Matplotlib, which is the standard plotting library for Python programs  You will use an iPython notebook to explore the basic Matplotlib statements to make and annotate a simple plot. Next, you will learn about how to make and interpret scatter plots by using Matplotlib. Scatter plots can highlight trends or correlations between two or more columns of a given data set.

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand how to use Matplotlib within an iPython notebook to make a simple, inline plot.
- Understand how to use Matplotlib to annotate a plot
- Understand how to use Matplotlib to make a scatter plot.
- Understand the difference between positive, negative, and null correlations.
- Understand how to graphically identify outliers.
