## Problem 5.1. Trigonometric Functions.

Create a simple plot that displays the sin(*x*) and cos(*x*) functions
  from *x* = -numpy.pi to *x* = numpy.pi.
  Use different colors for the two plots, which should be plotted in one figure.
  The plots should be properly labeled.
  Submit your IPython notebook via Moodle as a `FirstName_LastName_trig.ipynb`
  file for both instructor and peer assessment.

- Use
  [`numpy.linspace()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html)
  to create an array of floats
  between `-numpy.pi` and `numpy.pi`.
- Use
  [`numpy.sin()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sin.html)
  and
  [`numpy.cos()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cos.html)
  functions on the arrays.
- Use `%matplotlib inline` to embed your plot in the notebook.
- Always label you axes.
- Your figure should have a descriptive title
  and also put your first and last name in the title.
