## Problem 5.3. Weekend Departure Delays.

Using the 2001 Airline On-Time Performance data `2001.csv`, create a plot that 
 displays multiple histograms for the departure delay (`DepDelay`) distribution
 for Friday (`DaysOfWeek == 5`), Saturday (`DaysOfWeek == 6`), and Sunday
 (`DaysOfWeek == 7`). You should use different colors for the three histograms
 (Fri, Sat, Sun), which should be plotted side-by-side (like the last histogram
 in the IPython notebook of lesson 3), and the three histograms should be
 properly labeled. Submit your IPython notebook via Moodle as a
 `FirstName_LastName_weekend_delay.ipynb` file for both instructor and peer
 assessment.

- The `DaysOfWeek` column has values 1 (Monday) - 7 (Sunday).
- The column header for departure delay is `DepDelay`.
- There are missing values denoted by `NA` in the `DepDelay` column.
  Do not plot any data point that has `NA` in the `DepDelay` column.
- Choose your favorite method to extract the columns from the CSV file.
  See
  [Problem 5.2](https://github.com/EdwardJKim/info490/blob/master/week05/p2.md)
  for hints.
- Always label your axes. Your figure should have a descriptive title as well
  as your first and last name.
