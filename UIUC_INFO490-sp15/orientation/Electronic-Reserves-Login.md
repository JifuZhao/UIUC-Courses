#Electronic Reserves Login #

The library has adopted a new e-reserves system. To gain access to the e-reserve items for this course, you must first use your NetID and AD password to [login to the E-reserves System](https://reserves.library.illinois.edu/ares/).
For help accessing e-reserves, please see the [Reserves LibGuide](http://uiuc.libguides.com/reserves).

**IMPORTANT**: You will not see your courses and e-reserves for approximately four hours after logging in for the first time. If you still aren't seeing your e-reserves a day after logging in, please call B.A. Davis-Howe at (217) 300-4669 during normal office hours.

**SIPX Reserve Items**

Sometimes, you will click on an item in your e-reserves list and it will take you to the SIPX website and ask you to log in. Don't worry, this is a legitimate resource to log into. The Library uses SIPX for e-reserves that it needs to pay permissions for. Currently, you will have to create a very simple account (consisting of only a login, your name, and university email address) validating that you are a U of I student. You will receive a single email from the system to verify the email account. After responding to the email verification request, you will be able to log in with your NetID and password like any other U of I resource. To create the account, simply click on any of your e-reserves that had directed you to the SIPX website. All fees associated with the SIPX service are paid for by the University Library, and any data collected is only reported in the aggregate. No specific student information is shared without specific consent. **IMPORTANT**: If you create a SIPX account using any email address other than your netid@illinois.edu account, the site will ask you, rather than the library, to pay for the content.
