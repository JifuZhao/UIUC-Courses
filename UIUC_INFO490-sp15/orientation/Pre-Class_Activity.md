#Pre-Class Activity#
## Introduce Yourself##

Welcome! Before the course formally begins, I’d like you to take a few minutes to introduce yourself to the class and get to know your classmates a bit. Some of the work you do in this course, like the peer review, will involve some degree of interaction with your peers. Establishing personal interaction with your peers early in the course will make your online learning experience much more enjoyable and engaging.

## Time Estimate##
Approximately 1 hour.

### Part 1: Updating Your Profile###

If you haven't already done so, you should update your Moodle profile. Your Moodle profile gives your classmates easy access to a little bit about you. Since your classmates can quickly access your Moodle profile almost any time they see your name listed within the course, it is a powerful tool for helping them to get to know you and vice versa. Additionally, when you update your Moodle profile photo, it shows up next to your name in discussion forums, which is a great help to those individuals who can remember faces more readily than names. So, your first task is to update your Moodle profile.

Here are [Instructions for Updating Your Moodle Profile](http://publish.illinois.edu/atlas-tlt/students/editing-your-profile/)

### Part 2: Introductions ###

Second, use this discussion forum to provide a brief 2-3 paragraph introduction to your classmates. In your post, please consider the following questions:

- What is your name? What do you prefer to be called?
- Where are you from?
- What year are you in school and what is your major?
- Why are you taking this class, and what, in particular, interests you about data science?
- What is something you are looking forward to learning or doing in this class?
- Tell us something about yourself that has nothing to do with school.


Post your self-introduction by clicking the Add a new discussion topic button, below.

Read your classmates’ postings. Pick at least one of your classmates’ postings that is most interesting to you and add your friendly comments. Also be sure to click on the name or profile picture of your other classmates to see what they have added to their profile.
