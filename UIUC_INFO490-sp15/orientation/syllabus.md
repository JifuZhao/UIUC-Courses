# INFO 490: Introduction to Data Science #

INFO 490: Introduction to Data Science uses an project-based approach to
indoctrinate students into the tools and technologies necessary for
working with large data.

## Course Goals ##

Upon completion of this course, students will be expected to understand
the basic concepts of data science. Students will learn how to work at a
Unix prompt and how to use the Python programming language to process,
visualize, persist, model, and mine large data sets.

## Prerequisites ##

There are no pre-requisites for this course, except for an interest in
learning the basic skills necessary for being a data scientist and
access to a computer to participate in the course lectures, and to
complete the required course assignments. NOTE: To complete the
assignments in this course, a student will need to have root access to a
UNIX system, for example a Linux or mac based computer. Since installing
all of the software we use in this class can be difficult, we strongly
encourage students to use a virtual machine in which we have
pre-installed all course software. Thus, before starting the online
course, students will be expected to have successfully installed the
course-specific virtual machine (this requires installing the freely
available Docker application). Instructions are provided in the
Mandatory Orientation Module of this Moodle course site.

## Texts ##

There are no required textbooks for this course. Instead, we will
utilize internet accessible websites and documentation as supplemental
material to the lesson content.

## Weekly Format ##

Each week will provide learning objectives and an outline of the
activities for that week with a list of all deadlines and corresponding
point values for assignments.

### Readings ###

Readings will consist of articles and excerpts from books and Web sites.
You will be required to read and be familiar with the content of these
documents. Readings are contextualized as part of the weekly lesson
content and are located in the "Background" section of each lesson.

### Lessons ###

Lessons will expand upon, or clarify key concepts in the reading
assignments or supplement or add to the reading. All lessons for a given
week must be completed by 6:00 PM Central on Thursday of that week.

### Lesson Assessments ###

Each week will contain three lesson modules (except for the last week,
which will contain only one). A lesson module will will include a quiz
designed to be taken after completing the readings and carefully
reviewing the lesson material. Lesson quizzes will allow two attempts,
to ensure students have mastered the relevant material before advancing
to the next lesson module. The lessons assessments must all be completed
by 6:00 PM Central on Thursday of that week.

### Assignments ###

Each week will contain an assignment that will involve one or more
computational tasks related to the focus for that given week. The
assignment must be submitted via the Moodle Workshop tool for the
relevant week. The Assignment is due by 6:00 PM Central on Saturday of
that week. No submissions will be accepted past this deadline.

### Peer Review ###

Weekly assignments will be reviewed by course peers, as well as the
instructor. 40% of the grade for each weekly assignment submission will
derive from peer review, 60% from instructor review. You will receive 50
pts each week for simply viewing and grading your peers' assignments.
Note that you can (and should) still grade your peers even if you miss
an assignment submission. Peer review of an assignment must be completed
by 6:00 PM Central on Tuesday of the following week (i.e., you submit
your assignment on a Saturday and then must peer assess other students
assignments by the following Tuesday).

### Weekly Quizzes ###

In addition to the lesson quizzes, each week will conclude with a weekly
quiz. The weekly quiz is designed to test your overall mastery of the
content for each given week. Unlike the lesson quizzes, weekly quizzes
will be timed and will not allow multiple attempts. The quiz must be
completed by 6:00 PM Central on Friday of that week.

### Exams ###

This course is project-based in its use of assignments that build
progressively on content mastery, application, and peer review; there
are no exams in this course.

### Grading Distribution ###
|Assignment | Points| Occurrences| Total Points |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
|Pre-Class Activity: Introduce Yourself| 70|1|70|
|Orientation Quiz|70|1|70|
|Lesson Assessments|60|14 (Week 15 is only 20 points)|860|
|Weekly Quizzes|70|15(Week 1 is only 40 points|1020|
|Assignments (Weeks 1-14)|150|14 (Week 1 is only 30 points)|1980|
|***Total***|||***4000***|

### Grading Scale ###

Final grades will be graded on a curve, if necessary. The letter grade
cutoffs will be set at the traditional 90%, 80%, and 70% limits, and
plus/minus will be added if you are within two points of the traditional
cutoffs (so 100–98 is an A+ and 90–92 is an A-).

|Percentage|Letter Grade|
|--------|---------|
|98-100|A+|
|92-98|A|
|90-92|A-|
|88-90|B+|
|82-88|B|
