## INFO 490 Orientation Week: Docker

In this course, we will be using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), an open
source project that lets you virtually emulate Linux on your physical computer
(and [Boot2Docker](http://boot2docker.io/) if you are using Windows or Mac). This document provides instructions on:

1. [How to install Docker](docker_windows.md),

2. [How to run Docker](docker_running_ipynb.md) using a Docker container specifically built for INFO 490, and

3. [How to install shared folders](docker_folder_sharing.md).

Please go through the above before the class begins to make sure that you are
able to run Docker on your computer.
