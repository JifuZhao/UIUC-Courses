      "(If you are curious where this data came from, 1,000 tweets were fetched using the search query `#informatics` on Tuesday, February 3rd, 2015, around 10pm. See [Mining the Social Web 2nd Edition](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition) by Matthew A. Russell. [twitter_to_ascii.py](https://github.com/INFO490/spring2015/tree/master/week04/twitter_to_ascii.py) on the course Github repository is a Python 2 script that collects 1,000 tweets and generates an ASCII text file of status texts.)\n",

      "If you used `git clone`/`git pull` from `/data`, the path to the data file will be `/data/spring2015/week04/informatics.txt`. It's an ASCII text file, and when you first get a new data like this, it's a good idea to see how the data looks like. You have learned various ways to do this: you could write a short Python script that reads the file line by line and print them out; you could mount the data container onto a Docker container in terminal mode and use `head`; but here I'll show you how to use shell commands in IPython notebook.
