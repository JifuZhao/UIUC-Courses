### Problem 4.1. Simple Statistics I.

In this problem, you will write a function that calculates the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values from a list of integers.

 - Use the provided IPython notebook template [stats.ipynb](stats.ipynb).
 - Write a function named `get_stats()` takes one argument, which should be a list of integers, and returns a tuple `(minimum, maximum, mean, median)`. The minimum and maximum values can be integers, but mean and median must be returned as floats.

When you are done writing the `get_stats()` function, test your function by
running the following (provided in the template):
 
 - Generate a list of numbers from 0 to 50 by using
   [range()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range) (and
   [list()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list)).
 - Pass the above list to `get_stats()` as an argument.
 - Use the returned tuple to print out the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values in a nicely formatted manner. (If there is an even number of values in the list, there is no single middle value; in this case, take the median to be the mean of the two middle values.)

When you pass `list(range(51))` (a list of integers from **0** to **50**) to `get_stats()`, your output should be

        Minimum: 0
        Maximum: 50
        Mean: 25.0
        Median: 25.0

See the template for more examples.

Your `get_stats()` function should also be able to handle an unordered list
(Hint: use [sorted()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted)
in `get_stats()`). Try passing a *shuffled* list, which you can generate by

        >>> from random import shuffle
        >>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> shuffle(my_list)
        >>> print(my_list)
        [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]

or try passing a list with repeated values, e.g.

        my_list = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Does your function behave as expected?
