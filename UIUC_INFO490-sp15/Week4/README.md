## Advanced Python Programming Language ##

In this week, you will transition to more advanced Python programming concepts. First, you will learn how to work with advanced Python data structures like the List, Dictionary, String, and Tuple. Second, you will learn how to write an actual Python program that runs at the command prompt, before learning how to work with files from a Python program. Next you will learn about comprehensions and regular expression. Finally you will learn the basics of creating and using classes and objects in a Python program.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Effectively us the Basic Python data structures: list, dictionary, string, & tuple.
- Open, read, and write to files and work with the underlying file system.
- Write a Python program that runs at the command Prompt.
- Read, create, and apply comprehensions and regular expressions
