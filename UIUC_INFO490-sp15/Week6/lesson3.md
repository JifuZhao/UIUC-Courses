# Week 6 Lesson 3 #
## Summary Statistics ##

In this lesson, you will learn about summary statistics like the mean, median, and mode. You will also learn about descriptive density functions, like the probability density function and the cumulative density function, which can provide a summary model of a given dataset. Finally, you will learn about some of the many distribution functions, like the Binomial, Poisson, Gaussian, and Exponential, that can be used to effectively model data.

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the different summary statistics.
- Understand how to compute and use probability density functions and cumulativeve density functions.
- Know the more common distribution functions and their use in modeling data sets.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 3 hours.
