# Week 8 Lesson 1 #
## Introduction to Time Series Data ##

In this lesson, you will learn about time series data, which includes a range of different observed phenomena that are seen to vary in time. This includes scientific and engineering data, as well as humanities and social science data, for example, polling of people's opinions or their personal information. One of the most commonly recognized time series data originate in financial markets, where we might be interested in monitoring (or predicting) the price of a commodity or stock over time. To simplify working with time series data, in this lesson you will learn how to use the Pandas library to use the Series data structure to work with time-date data sets.

###Objectives ###

- Understand the basic concepts of a time series data.
- Understand how to create a time series data structure by using Pandas
- Understand how to work with Pandas time series data
