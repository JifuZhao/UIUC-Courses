# Week 8 Lesson 2 #
## Introduction to Time Series Data with Seaborn##

In this lesson, you will learn about making attractive visualizations of time series data. This includes understanding how to represent confidence intervals, how to compare multiple time series, how to select different statistical values, such as the mean or median, for plotting, and also changing the actual confidence intervals used for the display. Finally, you will learn about the importance of selecting an appropriate visualization technique that demonstrates the uncertainty in a  time series measurement.

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand how to make a Time Series plot by using Pandas and Seaborn.
- Understand how to label TimeSeries plots.
- Understand how to use different statistical measures and change confidence interval parameters when plotting a time series.
- Understand the different methods to visualize uncertainty in TimeSeries data.
