# Week 3 Lesson 1 #
## Working with the IPython Notebook ##

In this lesson, you will learn how to work with an IPython Notebook (note the name is being changed to Jupiter Notebook) from within your Docker INFO490 course container. You will first learn how to view notebooks online, before downloading them locally to execute. Next you will learn how to enter basic Python commands in the notebook and execute them. Finally, you will learn about IPython magic commands and how they can give you access to the underlying operating system and increased functionality.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- View an IPython notebook on github via the nbviewer.
- Download an IPython notebook and execute it by using your info490 Docker container.
- Execute Python commands in an IPython notebook.
- Understand basic IPython magic command syntax.

### Time Estimate ###
