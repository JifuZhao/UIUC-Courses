# Week 3 Lesson 2 #
## Introduction to Python Programming ##

In this lesson you will be working with the Python programming language. Initially, you will work at the Python prompt, and eventually move to writing a Python script or program. You will learn about the basic components of a Python program, including variables, expressions, and functions.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Use the Python interpreter.
- Describe the basic daa types provided by the Python language.
- Perform basic operations on Python variables.
- Write and use simple Python functions.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

### Readings ####

Read Chapters 1-3 in [Think Python](http://faculty.stedwards.edu/mikek/python/thinkpython.pdf).

#### *Optional Additional Readings*####

You will start by running codes in an IPython notebook, which you will run by using the course Docker image as a standalone container IPython server (as documented in Orientation Week). You also can open a Python prompt by running the course Docker image as an interactive container, and entering python3 at the Unix command prompt. Final, you also can write Python scripts or programs in a text file. This can be done by using vim, or if you prefer a graphical editor like Spyder, which can work on your host machine ash then you can use shared folders to run the python program in a running Docker container.

- [Google Developers Python Setup Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/set-up) on starting a Python interpreter or running a Python program at the command line. Note that in this course, the Docker image comes preinstalled with the latest version of Python3, as that is the future of the language. For the most part, there are no major differences that you will notice (the Python texts you will read are for Python 3), but since some optional readings still use Python 2, I want to make this point.
- [Discussion of Differences between Python 2 and Python 3](http://python3porting.com/intro.html), and a shorter [List of Changes from Python 2 to Python 3](http://inventwithpython.com/appendixa.html).
- Python website tutorial for [Python 2](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/index.html) and [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/index.html).
- Several free books, mostly written for Python 2:
	- [Open Tech School's Introduction to Programming with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/index.html)
	- [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/)
	- [Building Skills in Programming](http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/books/)
