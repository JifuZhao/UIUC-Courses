# Week 3 Lesson 3 #
## Python Functions ##

In this lesson, you will focus on the details of writing and using functions in a Python program (we will stay within the IPython notebook, primarily, although you can experiment with writing and executing Python programs in a file). First, you will learn about conditional programming. Next, you will learn how to write a function that returns one or more values. Finally, you will learn about iteration and algorithm design. 

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Write and use conditional statements in Python.
- Write Python functions that return data.
- Write and use iteration statements in Python.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.
