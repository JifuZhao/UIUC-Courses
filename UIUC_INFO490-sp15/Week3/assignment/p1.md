### Problem 3.1. The obligatory "Hello World" problem.

Write a very simple program that asks the user to enter his or her name, and
prints out a welcome message that is customized to the user's name. For
example, the program should wait for the user's input after printing out

```console
Enter your name: 
```

When you enter your name,

```console
Enter your name: info490
```

the output on the next line should be

```console
Hello, info490!
```

- Use the template file [hello.ipynb](https://github.com/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week03/hello.ipynb).
- Use the [`input()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input) to accept an input from the user and store it in a string variable.
- Use `print()` function to print the welcome message on the screen.
- When you are done, download as `<firstname>-<lastname>-hello.ipynb` and `<firstname>-<lastname>-hello.py`, and upload **both** `.ipynb` and `.py` files onto Moodle.
