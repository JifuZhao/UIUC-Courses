      "### The basics of relational database systems\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you can begin to develop database applications, you need to\n",
      "understand the basic concepts. Relational databases hold data. This data\n",
      "can be of different types, such as numbers, characters, or dates. Within\n",
      "the database, the data are organized into logical units called tables. A\n",
      "table is like a spreadsheet, because it contains rows of data. Each row\n",
      "is made up of a number of columns. The columns hold data of a specific\n",
      "data type, like integer values or strings of characters. In most cases,\n",
      "a database has more than one table. To relate the tables together, a\n",
      "database designer takes advantage of natural (or artificial) links\n",
      "between the tables. In a spreadsheet, you can link rows in different\n",
      "sheets by cell values. The same idea holds in a relational database, and\n",
      "the column used to make the link is referred to as a key column.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it easier to understand the purpose of a table or a particular\n",
      "column, you should select appropriate names. The naming conventions can\n",
      "vary between databases. For a SQLite database, individual names:\n",
      "\n",
      "- by default, case insensitive (although this can be changed),\n",
      "\n",
      "- are unlimited in length, but should be kept to a reasonable length\n",
      "(given readability constraints),\n",
      "\n",
      "- must begin with a letter or an underscore character, and\n",
      "\n",
      "- must only code alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can escape these rules by placing the name in double quotation\n",
      "marks, which allows names to be case sensitive and to include additional\n",
      "characters (including spaces). Doing this, however, is generally a bad\n",
      "practice: It requires the name to always be enclosed in double quotation\n",
      "marks and can easily confuse someone else who may be maintaining your\n",
      "code. Finally, a name can not be one of the reserved [keywords](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_keywords.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Class Style\n",
      "\n",
      "For this class, we will follow a specific style: All SQL commands are\n",
      "presented entirely in uppercase, and item names use camelCase. In\n",
      "camelCase style, words are joined together, and the first letter of each\n",
      "word-following the first one-is capitalized, such as aLongIdentifier.\n",
      "Combining these two styles together, these articles write SQL commands\n",
      "using the following style: SELECT aLongIdentifier FROM dataTable ;.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Schema\n",
      "\n",
      "Related tables are often grouped together into a schema. You can think\n",
      "of a schema as a container for all the related structure definitions\n",
      "within a particular database. A table name must be unique within a given\n",
      "schema. Thus, by using schemas, you can have identically named objects\n",
      "(such as tables) enclosed within different schemas. When you're using\n",
      "the Apache Derby database, a table is always in a schema. If you don't\n",
      "specify a schema explicitly, Derby implicitly uses the built-in apps\n",
      "schema. A second built-in schema called sys is used to isolate system\n",
      "tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the schema name to qualify a name. By default, SQLite uses\n",
      "the database name as the schema, and you do not need to prefix names to\n",
      "indicate the correct schema. For other databases, however, this is not\n",
      "the case. For these databases, you specify the schema name followed by a\n",
      "period and then the table name. For example, bigdog.products references\n",
      "the products table in the bigdog schema. Without the relevant schema\n",
      "name, a table name is said to be unqualified, as in products. When the\n",
      "schema name and the table name are completely specified, as in\n",
      "bigdog.products, the name is said to be fully qualified.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an abstract sense, these database concepts may seem confusing, but in\n",
      "practice they're fairly straightforward. For example, imagine you own a\n",
      "store called Bigdog's Surf Shop that sells a variety of items like\n",
      "sunglasses, shirts, and so on. If you want to be profitable, you must\n",
      "keep a close eye on your inventory so you can easily order additional\n",
      "inventory or change vendors to keep your overhead to a minimum. One\n",
      "simple method for tracking this information is to write entries in a\n",
      "table-like format:\n",
      "\n",
      "**<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>Product Table </DIV>**\n",

      "You may feel bewildered after looking at this syntax for the first time.\n",
      "But it's easy to follow once you have the basics down. The square\n",
