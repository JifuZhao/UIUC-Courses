      "\n",
      "While writing (and maintaining) Python code is often much easier than\n",
      "writing similar code in more traditional high performance computing\n",
      "languages such as C, C++, or Fortran, Python is generally slower than\n",
      "similar programs written in higher performance languages. In those cases\n",
      "where end-to-end performance (i.e., concept to execution) is less\n",
      "important, perhaps because an application will be run many times, a\n",
      "programmer will need to consider new approaches to increase the\n",
      "performance of a Python program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before proceeding further, however, some strong words of caution. Many\n",
      "programmers spend an inordinate amount of time on unneeded\n",
      "optimizations. To quote [Donald Knuth][dk] (1974 Turing Award Lecture):\n",
      "\n",
      "> Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of\n",
      "> it) in programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put simply, one should not worry about optimization until it has been\n",
      "shown to be necessary. And then one needs to very carefully decide what\n",
      "should can and should be optimized. This follows [Amdahl's law][al]\n",
      "which quantifies he maximum speed-up possible by improving the execution\n",
      "speed of only part of a program. For example, if only half of a program\n",
      "can be optimized, then the maximum possible speed-up is two times the\n",
      "original version. While modern multi- and many-core systems offer new\n",
      "performance benefits, they also come at an increased cost of code\n",
      "development, maintenance, and readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python, however, does provide both standard (i.e., included with the\n",
      "standard Python distribution) modules to leverage threading and\n",
      "multi-processing, as well as additional libraries and tools that can\n",
      "significantly improve the performance of specific types of applications.\n",
      "One major limitation that must be overcome when employing these\n",
      "techniques is the [_Global Interpreter Lock_][gil] or GIL. The GIL is\n",
      "used by the standard Python interpreter (known as CPython) to only allow\n",
      "one thread to execute Python code at one time. This is done to simplify\n",
      "the implementation of the Python object model and to safeguard against\n",
      "concurrent access. In other words, the entire Python interpreter is\n",
      "locked, and only one thread at a time is allowed access. \n",
      "\n",
      "While this simplifies the development of the Python interpreter, it\n",
      "diminishes the ability of Python programs to leverage the inherent\n",
      "parallelism that is available with multi-processor machines. Two caveats\n",
      "to the GIL are that the global lock is always released when doing IO\n",
      "operations (which might otherwise block or consume a lengthy period) and\n",
      "that either standard or third-party extension modules can explicitly\n",
      "release the global lock when doing computationally intensive tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the rest of this Notebook, we will first explore standard Python\n",
      "modules for improving program performance. Next, we will explore the use\n",
      "of the IPython parallel programming capabilities. We will then discuss\n",

      "One way to circumvent the GIL is to use multiple Python interpreters that each run in their own process. This can be accomplished by using the `multiprocessing` module. In this module, processes essentially take the place of threads, but since each process will read the same Python code file, we need to ensure that only one process (the main process) creates the other processes, or else we can create an infinite loop that quickly consumes all hardware resources.
