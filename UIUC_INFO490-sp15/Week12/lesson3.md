# Week 12 Lesson 3 #
## Statistical Exploration ##

In this lesson, you will learn how to apply Bayesian Statistical Analysis to a data set, which you will do by following along in Chapter 1 of the free [Book Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/tree/gh-pages/). First, you will have a quick review of Bayesian statistics. Second, you will apply Bayesian statistics to a few simple examples. Next you will review several probability distributions. Finally, you will learn about monte-carol Markov Chains (MCMC), and how to use PyMC to sample from the posterior to estimate model parameters.

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the relevance of Bayesian statistics to the construction of models.
- Understand how to use PyMC to sample from the posterior.
- Understand how to use MCMC to determine model parameters and confidence intervals.
