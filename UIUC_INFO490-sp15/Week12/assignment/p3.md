## Problem 12.3. MCMC.

- There is no template for this problem.

Use PyMC as demonstrated in
  [Chapter 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Chapter1.ipynb)
  of *Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers*
  to model the flight cancellation (`Cancelled == 1`) patterns
  at the O'Hare international airport (`Origin == 'ORD'`)
  from November, 2001 to December, 2001.

Note that you can use most of the code in *Probabilistic Programming and
  Bayesian Methods for Hackers* with minimal modification.
  The purpose of this problem is to force you to try the example code
  on the flights data set.

Note: It is possible that you get a different result from the
  following example (e.g. you see an increase/decrease on
  a day other than the Christmas day),
  because MCMC is a stochastic method and
  there's some inherent randomness in MCMC.
  Use the following example as a guide rather than
  try to exactly reproduce the sample plots.

When I used this DataFrame:

I was able to plot the posterior distribution of
  `lambda_1`, `lambda_2`, and `tau`:

I was also able to see a sudden change in the expected
  number of flights on the Christmas day:
