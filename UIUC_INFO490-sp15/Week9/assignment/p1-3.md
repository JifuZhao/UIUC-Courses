## Week 9 Assignment

- The template for this problem is [airports.ipynb](airports.ipynb).
- When you are done, rename your file to `FirstName_LastName_airports.ipynb`
  and submit it via Moodle.
- In this problem, you will visualize the total number of flights
  and current temperature of the top 20 airports 
  using the 2001 flight data.
- This week's assignment is one long, continuous problem,
  but I split it up into three sections for easier grading.

This is where we are going:

[CLICK HERE](https://rawgit.com/INFO490/spring2015/master/week09/images/top20.svg)

The circles are the top 20 airports in the U.S.
  The size of each circle is proportional to the total number of
  arrivals and departures in 2001.
  The redder the color, the higher the temperature;
  the bluer the color, the lower the temperature.
  Thus, you will visualize three pieces of information in one plot:
  the location of major airports, the size of the airports,
  and the current temperature.

### Problem 9.1. Top 20 Airports.

In the first part of this week's assignment,
  you will add the number of departures and the number of arrivals in 2001
  to find which 20 airports had the most number of flights.

You should use the `Dest` and `Origin` columns of the 2001 flight data `2001.csv`.
  Note that each airport is identified by
  [IATA codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_code),
  e.g. BWI, CLT.

```python
dest_origin = pd.read_csv('/notebooks/data/airline/2001.csv',
                          encoding='latin-1', usecols=('Dest', 'Origin'))
print(dest_origin.head())
```

```text
  Origin Dest
0    BWI  CLT
1    BWI  CLT
2    BWI  CLT
3    BWI  CLT
4    BWI  CLT
```

#### Function: get\_flights()

Count the total number of departures from and arrivals to each airport.
  In other words, first count the number of times each airport appears in the
  `Origin` column to get

```text
Dest
ABE      5262
ABI      2567
ABQ     36229
ACT      2682
ADQ       726
```

  (only the first 5 columns are shown).
  Then, count the number of times each airport apears
  in the `Dest` column to get

```text
Origin
ABE        5262
ABI        2567
ABQ       36248
ACT        2686
ACY           1
```

Add them up get the total number, and store the result in a column named `flights`,

```text
flights
ABE 10524
ABI  5134
ABQ 72477
ACT  5368
ACY     1
```

Note that some airports have no departures or arrivals (e.g.  `ACY`).

Hint: I would use `groupby(...).size()` on `Dest` and `Origin` columns to get
  the number of departures and arrivals, respectively.
  I would then use
  [`pandas.DataFrame.add()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/generated/pandas.DataFrame.add.html)
  (with `fill_value` and `columns` parameters).

In the end, when you execute

```python
flights = get_flights(dest_origin)
print(flights)
```

you should get

```text
flights
ABE    10524

To keep the problem simple, we will use only the top 20 airports.

```python
top20 = flights.sort('flights', ascending=False)[:20]
print(top20)
```

```text

### Problem 9.2. XML Scrapping.

As mentioned earlier, our airports are identified by IATA codes.
  However, the circles in the SVG file are identified by the city names
  (e.g. Chicago or San Francisco).
  For example, the circle that corresponds to O'Hare Airport is represented
  by the following code in
  [`airports.svg`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INFO490/spring2015/master/week09/images/airports.svg):

```xml
<circle cx="367.68198" cy="118.095" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" r="5" fill="red"
  id="Chicago"/>
```                                   

So we need to match the IATA codes with the city names.
  You could use a supplementary data set such as
  [airports.csv](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/supplemental-data.html)
  that contains all this information, but let's pretend that no such
  file exists and we have to gather this information ourselves.
                                                 
FAA provides an [XML service](http://services.faa.gov/docs/services/airport/),
  which lets us get the airport status, including known delays and weather data.
  You should read http://services.faa.gov/docs/services/airport/ and
  try a few sample XML request to make sure you understand how it works.
                                                         
From the XML response, we will extract the city name of the airport as well as
  the current temperature.

#### Functions: xml\_city() and xml\_temp()

- Write a function named `xml_city` that takes a url of an XML request (str)
  and returns the city name (str).
- Write a function named `xml_temp` that takes a url of an XML request (str)
  and returns the current temperature (float).

When you run

```python
sfo_city = xml_city("http://services.faa.gov/airport/status/SFO?format=application/xml")
sfo_temp = xml_temp("http://services.faa.gov/airport/status/SFO?format=application/xml")
print("The current temperature at {0} ({1}) is {2} ({3}) degrees Fahrenheit."
      "".format(sfo_city, type(sfo_city), sfo_temp, type(sfo_temp)))
```

you should get

```text
The current temperature at San Francisco (<class 'str'>) is 71.0 (<class
'float'>) degrees Fahrenheit.
```

(The temperature may be different.)

#### Function: add\_city\_temp()

- Write a function that takes a Pandas DataFrame (indexed by IATA codes)
  and appends two additional columns `city` and `temp`.
    
If you had a dataframe that looks like 

```python
print(top20.head(3))
```
```text
     flights
ORD   682636
DFW   624361
ATL   503163
```

then `add_city_temp()` should return

```python
top20 = add_city_temp(top20)
print(top20.head(3))
```
```text
     flights             city  temp
ORD   682636          Chicago    54
DFW   624361  Dallas-Ft Worth    68
ATL   503163          Atlanta    63
```

(The temperatures will be different in your case.)

Hint: Create a new column (e.g. `url`) and use the indices of the
  DataFrame
  to create appropriate links
  `http://services.faa.gov/airport/status/XXX?format=application/xml`
  for each airport.
  Use
  [`pandas.DataFrame.apply()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/generated/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html)
  and the `xml_city()` function to create a column named `city`.
  Similary, use `pandas.DataFrame.apply()` with `xml_temp()`
  to create a column named `temp`.
  Finally, use
  [`pandas.DataFrame.drop()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/generated/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html)
  to remove the `url` column.

#### Reset Index

(You don't have to write code for this part.
  Just run the code provided in the template.)

In Problem 3, it will be easier if the dataframe is indexed by
  `city` instead of IATA codes.
    
When you run 

```text
top20 = top20.reset_index().set_index('city')
print(top20.head(3))
```

you should get

```text
                index  flights  temp
city                                
Chicago           ORD   682636    54
Dallas-Ft Worth   DFW   624361    68
Atlanta           ATL   503163    63
```


### Problem 9.3. Data Visualization.

- Use the blank U.S. map with 20 major cities
  [airports.svg](https://rawgit.com/INFO490/spring2015/master/week09/images/airports.svg)
  to visualize the number of flights and the current temperature
  in `top20` dataframe.

![airports](https://rawgit.com/INFO490/spring2015/master/week09/images/airports.svg)

Lesson 3 covers how to use `BeautifulSoup` to parse an SVG file
  (which is in XML format),
  search for the FIPS code of each county, and replace the colors using a
  dataframe (unemployment data).
  Although we are searching for different objects (`circle`) and
  using a different data set (`top20`), the same principle applies.
        
Remember that each circle is represented by the following XML code:

```xml
<circle cx="367.68198" cy="118.095" stroke="black" stroke-width="1"
r="5" fill="red"
id="Chicago"/>
```

So you should use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the `usairports`
  (the contents of `airports.svg` file)
  and search for all instances of `circle`.
  Then, iterate over each instance of `circle`
  and replace the `r` variable with the number of flights
  `flights` in the `top20` dataframe
  (multiplied/divided by some proportionaly constant
  since a circle with a radius `r="682636"` would not work).
  You should also replace the `fill` variable with a color
  that corresponds to the current temperature `temp`.
  After replacing all instances of `circle`,
  display the result with
  `display_svg(soup.prettify(), raw=True)`.
