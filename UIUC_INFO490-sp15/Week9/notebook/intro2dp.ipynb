      "| $ | Matches sequence at the end of the line | `Python$` matches `Python` at the end of a line |\n",
      "| * | Matches zero or more occurrences of a pattern | `12*3` matches `13`, `123`, `1223`, etc. |\n",
      "| + |  Matches one or more occurrences of a pattern | `12+3` matches `123`, `1223`, etc. |\n",
      "| ? |  Matches zero or one occurrences of a pattern | `12?3` matches `13` and `123` |\n",
      "| { }| Match repeated qualifier | `{m, n}` means match at least `m` and at most `n` occurrences | \n",
      "| [ ] | Used to specify a character class | `[a-z]` means match any lower case character |\n",
