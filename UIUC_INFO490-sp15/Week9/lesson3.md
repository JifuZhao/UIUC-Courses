# Week 9 Lesson 3 #
## Working with Data ##

In this lesson, you will review a worked example that demonstrates how to work with different data sets to make an interesting data visualization known as a chloropleth. To do this we need to access web resources, parse an XML-based data format, extract meaningful data from a second web accessible resource, and combine it all into a new and interesting visualization.
