## Week 1 Assignment

### Problem 1

- First, make sure that you have followed the steps in the [Docker installation guides](../week00/README.md) from the orientation week, and have folder sharing working.

- Run a container with your data volume attached:

    ```console
    $ docker run -it --volumes-from my-data lcdm/info490 /bin/bash
    ```

- In the docker container, create a text file with your name and the server
  name (the Docker container ID):

    ```console
    root@4b13abb47ef9:/# echo "FirstName LastName" > /data/FirstName-LastName-hostname.txt
    root@4b13abb47ef9:/# hostname >> /data/FirstName-LastName-hostname.txt
    ```

    This will create a text file with your name and the server name in `/data` folder of the container. You should of course replace your name in the above commands. You might want to check if your file looks correct:

    ```console
    root@4b13abb47ef9:/# cat /data/FirstName-LastName-hostname.txt
    ```

    With folder sharing, you will be able to access this file from the host machine.

- Upload`<firstname>-<lastname>-hostname.txt` to Moodle.
