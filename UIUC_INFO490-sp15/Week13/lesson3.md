# Week 13 Lesson 3 #
## Clustering ##

In this lesson, you will learn about cluster finding, where we look for groups of points that are related in a particular space of attributes. Cluster finding can be used for classification, where each member of the cluster has the same or similar type, and it can be used for density estimation, where we replace a large range of points with their cluster representation. A popular method to perform unsupervised cluster finding is k-means, which we will learn to perform by using the sickout_learn library.
