# Week 13 Lesson 2 #
## Unsupervised Learning ##

In this lesson, you will learn about unsupervised learning by using a course IPython notebook and other online resources. Unsupervised learning can provide powerful insights into the nature of a dataset. Primarily, you will focus in this lesson on dimensional reduction, where you use unsupervised learning to reduce the volume of data being studied (e.g., the number of columns used to analyze a data set) by ranking the importance of different features.

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of unsupervised learning and dimensional reduction.
- Understand how to employ principal component analysis by using scikit-learn.
- Understand other dimensional reduction techniques.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 3 hours.
