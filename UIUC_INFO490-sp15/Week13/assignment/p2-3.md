## Problem 12.2 and 12.3 Dimensional Reduction and Clustering.

- The IPython notebook template for this problem is
  [delta.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week13/delta.ipynb).
- You also need to use
  [delta.csv](https://github.com/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week13/delta.csv)
  hosted on GitHub.

This problem will give you a chance to practice using dimensiona reduction (PCA)
  and clustering ($k$-means)
  by performing these machine learning techniques on
  [Delta Airline's aircrafts](http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-
with-us/airports-and-aircraft/Aircraft.html).

This problem is one continous problem, but I split into two parts for easier
grading.

## Problem 12.2 Diemnsional Reduction.


Delta Airline (and other major airlines) has data on all of their aircrafts
  on their [website](http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us
/airports-and-aircraft/Aircraft.html).
  For example, the following shows the specifications of AIRBUS A319 VIP.

### Download delta.csv.

In this problem, we will use
  [`delta.csv`](https://github.com/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week13/delta.c
sv),
  a CSV file that has the aircraft data taken from the Delta Airline website.
  So, the first step is to download
  [`delta.csv`](https://github.com/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/week13/delta.c
sv) from GitHub.
  You can use `wget` in the following code cell, or `git pull` and use that file
as well.

```python
%%bash
# edit paths as necessary
wget https://rawgit.com/INFO490/spring2015/master/week13/delta.csv -O /data/airline/delta.csv
```
```python
# edit path to where your delta.csv is located.
df = pd.read_csv('/data/airline/delta.csv')
```

This data set has 34 columns (including the names of the aircrafts)
  on 44 aircrafts. It inclues both quantitative measurements such as cruising
speed,
  accommodation and range in miles, as well as categorical data,
  such as whether a particular aircraft has Wi-Fi or video.
  These binary are assigned values of either 1 or 0, for yes or no respectively.


### Function: df\_to\_array()

We need to do some preprocessing before we actually apply the machine learning
techniques.

As explained in
  [Lesson 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/INFO490/spring2015/blob/master/w
eek13/intro2dm.ipynb),
  we need to build NumPy arrays because
  scikit-learn does not work natively with Pandas DataFrame.

- Write a function named `df_to_array()` that takes a DataFrame
  and returns a tuple of two NumPy ararys.
  The first array should have every columns and rows **except** the `Aircraft`
column.
  The second array is the labels that will be used as truth values, i.e. the
`Aircraft` column.


Here are some examples that you can use to test your function.

```python
print(data.shape)
```
```text
(44, 33)
```
```python
print(data[0])
```
```text
[  0.00000000e+00   0.00000000e+00   0.00000000e+00   2.10000000e+01

   0.00000000e+00   1.00000000e+00   0.00000000e+00   1.00000000e+00
   1.00000000e+00]
```
```python
print(data[:, 0])
```
```text
[  0.   19.4   0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.
   0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.
   0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.
   0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0. ]
```

### Standardization

PCA is a scale-dependent method. For example, if the range of one column is
[-100, 100],
  while the that of another column is [-0.1, 0.1], PCA will place more weight
  on the attribute with larger values.
  One way to avoid this is to *standardize* a data set by
  scaling each feature so that the individual features all look like
  Gausssian distributions with zero mean and unit variance.

For further detail, see
  [Preprocessing data](http://scikit-
learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html).
  The function scale provides a quick and easy way to
  perform this operation on a single array-like dataset.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(data)
data_scaled = scaler.transform(data)
```

### Function: perform\_pca()

- Write a funtion named `perform_pca()` that takes two NumPy arrays
  and returns a DataFrame.

The PCA returned the following.

```python
data_pca = perform_pca(data_scaled, labels)
print(data_pca.head(5))
```
```text
       PCA1      PCA2          Aircraft
0  2.656021 -1.382411       Airbus A319
1  6.766622  16.74373   Airbus A319 VIP
2  2.396654 -1.487692       Airbus A320
3  2.396654 -1.487692  Airbus A320 32-R
4 -4.862387  0.951892   Airbus A330-200

[5 rows x 3 columns]
```

### Plot: Scatter Plot Using Principal Components

- Create a scatter plot using the first and second
  principal compnents of `data_pca`.

## Problem 12.3. Clustering

In this problem, we will use the k-means algorithm to
  group similar aircrafts into clusters.


### Function: cluster()

- Write a function named `cluster()` that takes two NumPy arrays.
  The first array has the **scaled** attributes,
  while the second array has the attributes in terms of the first
  and second principal components.
  It should return a DataFrame with three columns:
  `PCA1`, `PCA2`, and `Cluster`.

The number of clusters `n_clusters` is an adjustable parameter.
  Different `n_clusters` corresponds to a different model.
  You may experiment with different values of `n_clusters` to
  find what you think best fits the data.
  In the following, I use `n_clusters=4`.

**IMPORTANT**:
  You **must** use the `random_state` parameter in the
  [`KMeans()`](http://scikit-
learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)
  function to ensure
  [repeatibility](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/utilities.html).
  Also, don't forget to use the optional parameter `n_clusters`.


Here's what I got:

```python
data_clust = cluster(data_scaled, data_pca[['PCA1', 'PCA2']].values)
print(data_clust.head(5))
```
```text
       PCA1      PCA2 Cluster
0  2.656021 -1.382411       2
1  6.766622  16.74373       3
2  2.396654 -1.487692       2
3  2.396654 -1.487692       2
4 -4.862387  0.951892       0

[5 rows x 3 columns]
```


### Plot: Scatter Plot of Clusters

- Use the `data_clust` DataFrame to create a scatter plot
  of the clustered data in the first and second
  principal component axes.

<img src="images/cluster_hw.png">


### Dicussion

You don't have to write any code in this section,
  but here's one interpretaion of what we have done.

Let's take a closer look at each cluster.

```python
df['Cluster'] = data_clust['Cluster']
df_grouped = df.groupby('Cluster').mean()
print(df_grouped.Accommodation)
```
```text
Cluster
0          244.733333
1           44.500000
2          153.625000
3           54.000000
Name: Accommodation, dtype: float64
```
```python
print(df_grouped['Length (ft)'])
```
```text
Cluster
0          190.538400
1           84.810750
2          137.048083
3          111.000000
Name: Length (ft), dtype: float64
```

Cluster 3 has only one aircraft:

```python
clust3 = data_pca[data_clust.Cluster == 3]
print(clust3.Aircraft)
```
```text
1    Airbus A319 VIP
Name: Aircraft, dtype: object
```

Airbus A319 VIP is not one of Delta Airline's regular fleet and is one of
  [Airbus corporate jets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_Corporate_Jets).

Cluster 1 has four aircrafts:

```python
clust1 = data_pca[data_clust.Cluster == 1]
print(clust1.Aircraft)
```
```text
33    CRJ 100/200 Pinnacle/SkyWest
34          CRJ 100/200 ExpressJet
37                            E120
40                         ERJ-145
Name: Aircraft, dtype: object
```

These are small aircrafts and only have economy seats.

```python
cols_seat = ['First Class', 'Business', 'Eco Comfort', 'Economy']
print(df.loc[clust1.index, cols_seat])
```
```text
First Class  Business  Eco Comfort  Economy
33            0         0            0        1
34            0         0            0        1
37            0         0            0        1
40            0         0            0        1

[4 rows x 4 columns]
```

Next, we look at Cluster 0:

```python
clust0 = data_pca[data_clust.Cluster == 0]
print(clust0.Aircraft)
```
```text
4              Airbus A330-200
5        Airbus A330-200 (3L2)
6        Airbus A330-200 (3L3)
7              Airbus A330-300
13        Boeing 747-400 (74S)
15        Boeing 757-200 (75E)
20        Boeing 757-200 (75X)
22        Boeing 767-300 (76G)
23        Boeing 767-300 (76L)
26        Boeing 767-300 (76T)
28    Boeing 767-300 (76Z V.1)
29    Boeing 767-300 (76Z V.2)
30        Boeing 767-400 (76D)
31            Boeing 777-200ER
32            Boeing 777-200LR
Name: Aircraft, dtype: object
```

These aircrafts do not have first class seating:

```python
print(df.loc[clust0.index, cols_seat])
```
```text
First Class  Business  Eco Comfort  Economy
4             0         1            1        1
5             0         1            1        1
6             0         1            1        1
7             0         1            1        1
13            0         1            1        1
15            0         1            1        1
20            0         1            1        1
22            0         1            1        1
23            0         1            1        1
26            0         1            1        1
28            0         1            1        1
29            0         1            1        1
30            0         1            1        1
31            0         1            1        1
32            0         1            1        1

[15 rows x 4 columns]
```

Finally, cluster 2 has the following aircrafts:

```python
clust2 = data_pca[data_clust.Cluster == 2]
print(clust2.Aircraft)
```
```text
0                Airbus A319

19      Boeing 757-200 (75V)
21            Boeing 757-300
24      Boeing 767-300 (76P)
25      Boeing 767-300 (76Q)
27      Boeing 767-300 (76U)

The aircrafts in cluster 2 have first class seating but no business class.

```python
print(df.loc[clust2.index, cols_seat])
```
