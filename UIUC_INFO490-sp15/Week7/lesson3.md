# Week 7 Lesson 3 #
## Linear Modeling ##

In this lesson, you will learn about applying the basic statistical concepts you covered in the first two lessons to perform statistical decision making. First, you will learn about hypothesis testing, including the definition of the chi-squared test. Next you will cover estimation in more detail. Finally, you will learn about quantifying correlation, including the concept of a covariance matrix.

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the Relationship between a scatter plot and a linear model
- Understand how to display and interpret the uncertainty on a linear model fit
- Understand the utility of jitter in scatter plots.
- Know how to plot joint distributions.
