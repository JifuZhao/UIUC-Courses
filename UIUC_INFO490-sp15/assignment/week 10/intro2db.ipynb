      "\n",
      "Before jumping into a discussion of data persistence technologies, and\n",
      "database systems in particular, I want to take some time to discuss how\n",
      "I recommend you work with these IPython Notebookes.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create a Docker container from our course Docker image by executing\n",
      "`docker run`. This command should be run with the `-it` flag for\n",
      "interactive use and the `-v` flag to share local folders with the\n",
      "running Docker container. On my Mac OSX laptop, I run the docker\n",

      "docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -e \"PASSWORD=temp123\" -v /Users/rb/i2ds:/notebooks/i2ds lcdm/info490\n",

      "You should change the local directory (for me this is /Users/rb/i2ds) to\n",
      "your local equivalent. On a Mac OSX system this means changing `rb` to\n",
      "your username. On a Windows system, the change will be similar to\n",
      "`/c/Users/rb/i2ds`, assuming your username was `rb`. Note that you\n",
      "should understand every flag in this invocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Open a terminal window in the running Docker container. This requires\n",
      "knowing the name of the running container, which you get from \n",
      "`docker ps`, and then issuing a `docker exec` command to open a terminal in the\n",
      "running container. So assuming `docker ps` tells me my IPython server\n",
      "is running in a container named `silly_lovelace`, I would open a\n",
      "terminal window into this container by issuing the following command:\n",
      "\n",
      "`docker exec -it silly_lovelace /bin/bash`\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Once I have a terminal open into this running Docker container (which\n",
      "I can tell because the prompt changes to `#`, I `cd` into the\n",
      "`/notebooks/i2ds` directory, and obtain the latest course git\n",
      "repository. For example, I can issue the following `git clone` the first\n",
      "time I do this, and afterwards I can change into the repository and\n",

      "\n",
      "`git clone https://github.com/INFO490/spring2015`\n",

      "**Database administrator (DBA)**: Responsible for the overall operation\n",
      "of the database system, which includes the selection and layout of the\n",
      "underlying hardware, the installation and optimization of the database\n",
      "server (especially given the hardware being used), and the day-to-day\n",
      "operations of the database server, such as data backup and recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Database developer**: Responsible for the actual databases in\n",
      "operation, including designing databases, schemas, tables, table\n",
      "relationships, and indexes as well as optimizing queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Database application developer**: Responsible for integrating\n",
      "application code with the underlying database by using database\n",
      "application programming interfaces (APIs) to store and retrieve data as\n",
      "necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the previous discussion leaves you feeling intimidated, that's OK,\n",

      "why, let's examine a specific example in more detail: online banking.\n",
      "When you connect to your bank's Web site, you provide your credentials\n",
      "(most likely a username and password) and thereby gain access to your\n",

      "movies) popular test to determine whether a diamond is real is to run it\n",

      "materials known, a real diamond easily cuts the glass surface; a fake,\n",
      "especially if it's made of glass itself, won't.\n",

      "easily retrieve the data later. You also want your database to allow\n",
      "multiple programs (or people) to work with the database without\n",

      "account -- to be treated as a single transaction. Consistency guarantees\n",
      "that both operations in the transaction either succeed or fail. That\n",
      "way, your money isn't lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Isolation** means that independent sets of database transactions are\n",
      "performed in such a way that they don't conflict with each other.\n",

      "### What is SQLite?\n",
      "\n",
      "SQLite is quite different than traditional relational database\n",
      "systems. SQLite does not have a separate server process, instead SQLite\n",
      "is a software library that, as the website states:\n",
      "\n",
      "> implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration,\n",
      "> transactional SQL database engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before progressing, lets examine each of these concepts in turn:\n",
      "\n",
      "- *self-contained*: Nothing else is needed to use SQLite but the\n",
      "software library. Since, by default,  this comes with Python, we can use\n",
      "SQLite without any additional software downloads or installs. in\n",
      "addition, if you want to embed SQLite in your own application, you can\n",
      "obtain a single ANSI-C file that contains the entire SQLite library.\n",
      "\n",
      "- *serverless*: We interact with the SQLite database by using the\n",
      "SQLite library. The database is stored in a single file that is platform\n",
      "independent (so you can simply copy it over to a new machine with no\n",
      "further effort).\n",
      "\n",
      "- *zero-configuration*: SQLite does not use a server process, so there\n",
      "is no configuration required. While you can customize sqlite to change\n",
      "[default limits][1], for most applications this is unnecessary. You can\n",
      "also pre-specify certain options for the `sqlite3` command line client\n",
      "in a separate configuration file (e.g., `.sqliterc`, which is located in\n",
      "the current user's home directory).\n",
      "\n",
      "- *transactional*: A transaction is a logical set of operations. SQLite\n",
      "is ACID-complaint by implementing [atomic commits][2], which means that\n",
      "either every operation within the transaction completes successfully or\n",
      "none of them do. No partial writes are persisted, so that the database\n",
      "is always in a consistent state.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this power, it is even more surprising that the SQLite library is\n",
      "quite small, and can be compacted to as small as **300 kb** if required.\n",
      "\n",
      "SQLite by default will store data in a single database file; however, it\n",
      "can also be used as an _in memory_ database. SQLite has been distributed\n",
      "as a component within the Python language for many years, but also has a\n",
      "stand-alone command line interface client, called `sqlite3` that we will\n",
